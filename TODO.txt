Urgent
========

* put channel info in h5 file: channel names and dat channels
* more info in xml file
* option to rewrite old folder
* check over the work on resorting and deleting noise points. see if it solves memory issues. MERGE with dorothy work!
* comment more functions
* triangulation gives weird edges. figure out better way to assign edges
* assign edges for double-edge probes
* Something for split clusters (due to drift?)
* document output files
* document cluster merging procedure
* document new probe file specification

Fixed but untested
=====================
* remove duplicate spikes
* merge sorts
* Build fails for older numpy version--must recompile cython [This seem to be due to sudo $PATH in ubuntu]
* test_tools fix data dir

Non-urgent
=====================

* entering, exiting give wrong filename
* Doc should show acg for d11221 so you know what error rate to expect for a given acg
* subset_sorting.py is a mess--refactor into smaller functions
* profile, especially find_cutoffs
* detect/align positive spikes?
* write a tool for line profiling a lot of funcs.
